        I am intrested in Football and Basketball and just a lot of sports. The main reason why I came to Tech is for Cyber security,
        it always intrest how you can defend a computer or a system from viruses or just any Cyber attack.When I was younger and I 
        would see like 0010 10101010 like Binary in cartoons and
        I thought it was so cool and im glad I know how to count in it and understand it.
        On my free time I tend to go to the gym and lift and soon to go to work for football, at home activites I like doing is 
        Sleeping, Playing Video Games or just talking to my girlfriend.
